let firstName= 'Tyler'
let lastName= ' Thomas'
let name= firstName + lastName 

b = 1
c = 4
b + c
=5
let calculation = b + c


let unexpected = firstName + c

1. 
a.Boolean   Boolean(10 > 9)        // returns true
b.Null let person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
person = null;        // Now value is null, but type is still an object
c.Undefined car = undefined;        // Value is undefined, type is undefined
d.Number var x = 3.14;    // A number with decimals
e.String let a = 'hello world'
f.Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6)
object let person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
array let cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];


If you add a number to a work they just combine like this
b =2
c = 'hello'
b+c=
'2hello'


How do you convert a string to a number?

let n = num.toString();

What is the difference between a float and an int?
Integers and floats are two different kinds of numerical data. 
An integer (more commonly called an int) is a number without a decimal point. 
A float is a floating-point number, which means it is a number that has a decimal place. 
Floats are used when more precision is needed.

Give an example of why you would want to use each one?
You would want to use a float if you were going for higher accuracy. 

Give an example of adding "Hello" and "World" together to get "Hello World".

let a = 'Hello'
let b = ' World'
a + b =
'Hello World'
